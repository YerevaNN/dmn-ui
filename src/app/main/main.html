      <h3>Dynamic Memory Networks by
        <small>YerevanNN</small>
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a playground to experiment with 
        <a href="https://github.com/YerevaNN/Dynamic-memory-networks-in-Theano" target="_blank">our implementation</a>
        of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07285" target="_blank">Dynamic memory networks by Kumar et al.</a> 
        DMNs are designed to answer questions related to the given stories. 
        They are trained on datasets of lots of stories and questions. 
        All available models here are pretrained on Facebook's 
        <a href="http://fb.ai/babi" target="_blank">bAbI tasks</a>. 
        The vocabulary is quite limited but it is enough to describe various reasoning tasks.
        <code>Sample</code> button will load random samples from the bAbI test set. 
        Read more in our <a href="http://yerevann.github.io/2016/02/23/playground-for-babi-tasks/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.
